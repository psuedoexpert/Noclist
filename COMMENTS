# Instructions

Below are complete instructions on how to build and run the Noclist JavaScript application.

## Requirements

* Tested and run with Node.js version 14.0+
* Docker running the noclist container (per assignment instructions)

## Installation

1. Install and run Docker
2. Clone the repository
3. Change directory into the cloned repository
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Usage

The BADSEC server will run on port 8888. You can start it with:

`docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 adhocteam/noclist`

You should see `Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8888`.

Once the **BADSEC** server is running, you can run the Noclist application in another Terminal window with this command from within the project directory:

`node index.js`

You should see results printed to stdout or errors printed to stderr.

If you have any trouble getting the server running, or any other questions, please feel free to open an issue on this repository.

## Output

Outputs a JSON-formatted list of user ids to stdout:

```json
["9757263792576857988", "7789651288773276582", "16283886502782682407", "...etc"]
```

## Testing

In a Terminal window within the project directory, run this command:

`npm test`

You should see test results printed in the output.
